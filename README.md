# Jake's nvim config (part 2)

This is my continously evolving nvim config based on LazyVim.

## Features
- runs on windows this time
- kanagawa dragon loads as the default theme
- LSP has been enabled for: git, json, md, c#, python, js/ts and dotfiles
- bufferline is gone in favor of navigating buffers through `<Space>fb`
- neotree is completely replaced with snacks picker
- lualine is moved to the top of the screen (thanks chatgpt)

## TODOs
- add vimtex back in if I'm ever to do math notes or scientific papers not on obsidian
